    <Element Usage="0" MinimumCount="1" MaximumCount="1" Name="Given Name"><![CDATA[Your given name is a simple way by which people may address or refer to you in settings that are neither extremely formal nor extremely informal. Although your character does not have any memories of their life before waking up, they still recall their given name; if anything, your given name is one of the few fragments of your identity that you can cling to. You don't know why, but deep down in your gut you #Fknow#0 the name you were given.]]></Element>    <Element Usage="6" MinimumCount="1" MaximumCount="1" Name="Family Name"><![CDATA[Your surname is another part of the picture of your personal identity. Similarly to your given name, you have an innate, strongly felt association with your surname. At an intellectual level you understand that your surname is the name of your family, and is likely associated with your ancestoral background. At a practical level, however, your surname conjures no images of otherwise forgotten family members, nor could you readily identify any hypothetical origins of your ancestors.]]></Element>    <Element Usage="2" MinimumCount="0" MaximumCount="1" Name="Nickname"><![CDATA[Your character may or may not recall having a nickname of some kind; an additional name, similar in usage to your given name but generally reserved for less formal situation and more intimate associations. Just like all your other names, you instinctually know it as fact that this name is your nickname (and also what a nickname is), but as to the circumstances of how, when, or why you acquired it, you remain clueless. Dimunatives or variations to your given name are also acceptable choices for a nickname: for example, a character named Kathrine might have a nickname of "Kathy".]]></Element>
